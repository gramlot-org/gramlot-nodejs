# Gramlot Node.js native HTML host

The native 0.1.0 profile exports `startNativeServer` from
`gramlot-nodejs/native` for Node and `gramlot-nodejs/bun` for Bun. It hosts
trusted JavaScript Gramlot Page modules through the clean core's Host. The
reusable working launchers are in the [Hello World application](https://github.com/gramlot-org/gramlot-examples/tree/main/apps/hello-world):

```sh
cd ../gramlot-examples/apps/hello-world
npm run start:node
# Or, with Bun installed:
bun run start:bun
```

Install the local core, adapter and example npm artifacts with their current
first-party dependency graph before launching; these package names do not yet
imply registry availability. The page imports `Page` from `@gramlot/native-html/page`
and the Node/Bun servers require no Python process or database. See the
[native host guide](docs/010-native-html.md) for API and verification.

## Historical PoC server

The following `npm start` instructions run the older sibling-PoC server. They
are preserved as experimental history and are outside native 0.1.0 compatibility.

Public experimental repository: Node.js builds Gramlot Source and serves the existing
browser runtime. No Express, Python process, database, or npm install is required
to run it. This is not a released or accepted Gramlot server adapter.

Keep this checkout beside `gramlot-poc`, whose prepared browser distribution is
required. From this repository:

```sh
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8070. `/` demonstrates a live input, data formula and counter;
`/about` explains the boundary. Both pages include Show source and a fixed
bottom-right Inspector icon; `/health` reports the runtime build.
`PORT` overrides the port. `GRAMLOT_BROWSER_DIR` overrides the absolute path to
`gramlot-poc/src/gramlot/resources/browser`.

```sh
npm test
```

The runtime test additionally requires the laboratory's existing
`js/dom/node_modules/jsdom` installation. No test dependency is needed by the host.

See [architecture and verification](docs/005-node-host.md).
